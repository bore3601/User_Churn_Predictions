# User_Churn_Prediction
In this project, I use supervised learning models (11+) to identify customers who are likely to stop using the service in the future. Furthermore, I will analyze top factors that influence user retention and help the company to prevent user churn.

**Data**: A dataset of cell phone service customers. The data contain the information of customers' plans and usage of the service, as well as whether or not they stopped using the service eventually. 
    Data Source: https://www.sgi.com/tech/mlc/db/churn.all  
    Data info: https://www.sgi.com/tech/mlc/db/churn.names

**Objective**: My goal is to understand what factors contribute most to user churn and create a model that can predict if a certain customer will leave drop the service or not.
